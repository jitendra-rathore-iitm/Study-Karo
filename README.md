## 💡 Inspiration

The idea behind **Study Karo** was simple: students today are overwhelmed with information but lack the right tools to process, retain, and engage with it efficiently. What if you had an AI tutor available 24/7? What if it could adapt to *your* learning style, summarize complex topics, and even answer questions like a human professor?

**Study Karo is that tutor.**
